Title: Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture
Version: 4.6.1
Date: 2023-07-10
Description: Functions to estimate the density and size of a spatially 
  distributed animal population sampled with an array of passive detectors, 
  such as traps, or by searching polygons or transects. Models incorporating 
  distance-dependent detection are fitted by maximizing the likelihood. 
  Tools are included for data manipulation and model selection.
